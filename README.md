# UNet3D-Binary-Task
This is a UNet3D model designed for medical image segmentation.

Note: Most of this was AI-assisted, but I have manually debugged everything, so it is safe to use.

This code is primarily developed for tumor analysis in medical images.

It is available in both Traditional Chinese and English versions, with detailed information included.
