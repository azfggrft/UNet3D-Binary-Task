First, please install all the libraries listed in requirements.txt and make sure that CUDA and other related environments are properly configured.

Please follow the dataset structure below:

dataset/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels/
    ├── val/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels/
    └── test/
        ├── images/
        └── labels/


After installation, simply open train.py to start the process.

By default, training results will be saved in the train_end folder, and prediction results will be saved in the predict folder.

Around line 191 in the code, you can adjust various training parameters according to your needs, such as the optimizer type (Adam, SGD, etc.), data augmentation methods, 
batch size, and more. Once the settings are configured, you can start the training.

Currently, this program only supports binary images (labels: 0 and 1) and accepts only the following file formats: nii or nii.gz.

For more detailed information on data augmentation, please refer to:
